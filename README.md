# Lab 1 Serverless System
In Lab 1, we get familiar with building a feature pipeline, a training pipeline, and an inference 
pipeline with Modal, Hugging Face, and Hopsworks. 

We learned serverless machine learning with Iris flower dataset, which predicts the variety of a flower
according to the given length and width of the petal and sepal. 

Then we use serverless machine learning to predict if a passenger is survived or not with the given
Titanic dataset. 

With those training models, we create an interactive UI that make predictions based on user inputs. We 
also created a dashboard UI to display a prediction with randomly generated inputs.
